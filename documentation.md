## Design Decisions

Our design decisions for the Fusion F1 project were heavily influenced by the official brand assets and styling of the Formula One website. We aimed to create a visually appealing, minimalistic, and user-friendly interface that closely resembles the original Formula One website while incorporating our own unique touches.

- ### Brand Consistency

One of our primary design goals was to maintain consistency with the official Formula One brand assets. We carefully replicated the color scheme, typography, and visual elements used on the official website to ensure that users feel a sense of familiarity and continuity.

- ### Attractiveness

We prioritized the attractiveness of our design to capture the excitement and energy of Formula One racing. Vibrant colors, sleek typography, and dynamic imagery were utilized to create a visually engaging experience that draws users in and encourages exploration.

- ### Minimalism

In line with modern design trends and best practices, we opted for a minimalist approach to keep the interface clean and uncluttered. By eliminating unnecessary elements and focusing on essential content and functionality, we aimed to enhance usability and streamline the user experience.

- ### User-Friendly Navigation

User-friendliness was a key consideration throughout the design process. We implemented intuitive navigation patterns and clear call-to-action buttons to guide users seamlessly through the website. Whether they're exploring race schedules, reading articles, or managing their profiles, we wanted users to feel confident and comfortable navigating our platform.

- ### Responsive Design

Recognizing the importance of accessibility across devices, we ensured that our design is fully responsive and optimized for various screen sizes and resolutions. Whether users are accessing the website on desktops, tablets, or smartphones, they can enjoy a consistent and enjoyable experience without sacrificing functionality or aesthetics.

By incorporating these design decisions, we aimed to create a Fusion F1 website that not only mirrors the style and branding of Formula One but also stands out as a visually striking and user-friendly platform for F1 fans worldwide.

## Accomplishments

In relation to our original proposal and plan, we are pleased with the progress and achievements of the Fusion F1 project. While there were some adjustments and refinements along the way, overall, we successfully implemented the core features and met the primary objectives outlined in our initial proposal and plan.

We were able to implement the key functionalities outlined in our proposal and plan, including user authentication, profile management, and race data visualization. These features were essential for providing users with a comprehensive and engaging experience on the Fusion F1 website.

Our design decisions aimed at creating an attractive, minimalistic, and user-friendly interface were largely successful. We maintained consistency with the official Formula One brand assets and styling, while also incorporating our own unique touches to enhance the overall aesthetics of the website.

Throughout the development process, we adhered to our milestone schedule outlined in the plan. We successfully tagged versions for review and grading at each milestone, ensuring that our progress remained on track and aligning with the expectations set forth in the project timeline.

While we encountered some challenges and adjustments were necessary, our team demonstrated flexibility and adaptability in addressing them. We were able to make necessary refinements to our original plan based on feedback and changing requirements, ultimately enhancing the overall quality of the project.

In reflection, we are satisfied with the outcomes of the Fusion F1 project. We believe that we have delivered a product that not only meets but also exceeds the expectations set forth in our proposal and plan. Moving forward, we are excited to showcase our project and continue refining and enhancing it based on user feedback and further iterations.

## User Guidelines

For detailed user guidelines and instructions on how to interact with our website, please refer [here](README.md).

## Lessons Learned

- ### Choice of Technologies

We are confident that we chose the right technologies for the Fusion F1 project. Our selection of React for frontend development provided us with a robust and efficient framework for building dynamic user interfaces. Additionally, leveraging Flask for the backend allowed us to implement essential functionalities such as user authentication and data management effectively. The decision to use Figma for design and collaboration further facilitated seamless integration between design and development phases. Overall, the chosen technologies enabled us to achieve our project objectives efficiently and effectively.

- ### Project Scope

We believe that we scoped the project appropriately in our proposal.md and plan.md documents. While there were aspects of the project that we did not include in the initial plan, such as advanced features or additional functionalities, these decisions were made deliberately based on realistic assessments of time constraints and resource availability. By prioritizing essential features and functionalities in our plan, we ensured that the project remained manageable within the given timeframe and resources. Any deviations from the initial scope were communicated and justified within the project team, allowing us to maintain focus on delivering a high-quality product that met our stakeholders' needs.

- ### Most Compelling Part of the Project

Paul found the most compelling aspect of the project to be teaching other team members about React. By sharing his knowledge and expertise, Paul played a crucial role in empowering the team to leverage React effectively, fostering collaboration and skill development among team members.

- ### Most Challenging Part of the Project

Fixing CSS to Meet Project Needs: Another challenging aspect was refining and customizing CSS to align with the project's design requirements. Addressing CSS issues and ensuring consistency and responsiveness across different screen sizes demanded attention to detail and iterative refinement to achieve the desired visual and functional outcomes.
